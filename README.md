Software Engineering Task 3 - 2025

---

## Project Overview
This project is a 2D educational platformer game developed in Unity. It is designed to introduce students to fundamental physics concepts in a more engaging and interactive way. By combining game mechanics with educational content, it aims to improve student focus, motivation, and curiosity about learning.

## How to Run the Program

### macOS:
1. Download the `PhysicsGame_MacBuild.zip` file.
2. Extract the zip file to reveal the `.app` file.
3. Open the `.app` file to play.

### Windows:
A Windows build is currently not available due to platform-specific module limitations on macOS. The full Unity project is available and can be rebuilt on Windows using Unity version `6000.1.0f1` or later with the Windows IL2CPP module installed.

## Features
- Player movement and jumping system
- Physics concepts displayed in-game via signs
- Login and sign-up system with secure password hashing
- User-friendly UI and scene management

## Requirements to Build from Source
- Unity Editor version `6000.1.0f1`
- TextMeshPro (included by default in Unity 2D template)
- Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- Cinemachine (Unity package manager)
- For Windows build: IL2CPP module installed

## Additional Information
- The complete Unity project is included in the repository.
- Documentation and testing materials are located in the `Docs/` folder.
- This project was developed using macOS. Compatibility with Windows depends on module availability and proper Unity setup.
